# Is multiple inheritance supported in java ?

"""
    Ans :     

    Java doesn't support multiple inheritances in classes
    because it can lead to diamond problem and rather than
    providing some complex way to solve it, there are better
    ways through which we can achieve the same result as multiple
    inheritances.
